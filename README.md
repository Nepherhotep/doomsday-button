Overview
===============

First of all, what is a project about? Doomsday Button actually is a wireless keyboard with only one button.
Pressing this button hits a special hotkey, in my case it is SHIFT-F10, I use it to run "Make project" command in Idea IDE and XCode.

Here is a photo of the resulting device:

Whatch on Youtube how it looks like:

Why I decided to build it?
Once I found it quite inconvenient to press Fn+SHIFT+F10 every time I want to build project.
So I had an idea to assemble a big red button and use it as a hotkey.

After a short research, I thought that my button would be connected via bluetooth as a HID device.
For that purposes I ordered Bluesmirf HID Modem https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10938 

Actually it is a main part of the button since it works as a bluetooth HID device.
