Overview
===============

Doomsday button is a bluetooth HID keyboard button. I'll use it as a hardware hotkey to build projects in XCode and Idea.
Button will be connected to my laptop via bluetooth and when it is pressed, it will fire shift-F10 (or CMD-R) key combination.

The button itself is a big one designed for factory equipments. Here is a photo.

The electronic scheme is based on Bluesmirf bluetooth HID modem.
