Bluetooth Modem - BlueSMiRF HID
===========

First we need to connect modem to computer using usb-to-serial cable and setup some parameters. 
Attention - we need usb-to-serial cable with TTL levels which uses 5v instead of rs232 12v.
5v is exact voltage the BlueSMiRF HID need.

Connect modem in a way below:

```
Modem Pins       Cable Pins
            
VCC ------------ VCC

GND ------------ GND

TX-0 ----------- RX

RX-1------------ TX

RTS-0 ----+
          |
CTS-1 ----+
```

Launch CoolTerm app, or your favorite terminal application and connect to modem.
Terminal application options - no flow control, baudrate 115200, local echo (optional), CR on "Enter".

Then type in ```$$$``` and modem should response ```CMD``` - it means your are in command mode.

Now you can change your modem's parameters. All the commands has to be followed by CR symbol.

- ```SN,Doomsday button``` - change its name to "Doomsday button".
- ```SU,9600``` - change baudrate to 9600 instead of 115200 if you wish. Don't forget to change this option also in the terminal application later.
- ```S~,6``` - change profile to HID instead of default SPP (since 6.10 firmware version). After this command the modem will be visible as a keyboard.
- ```SM,6``` - with this option the modem will reconnect automatically after power off/on.
- ```R,1``` - reboot modem with new parameters.
